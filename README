This is a project to help those who want to learn kubernetes by simply deploying an ec2 cluster into AWS 
via Terraform. This creates 3 ec2 instances in the public subnet of the default vpc of AWS. Then the 
Scripts will run on the master and the workers. These script install k8 and join them together in the 
cluster as well as enable proxy access from each. Once you apply the Terraform it will give you the IP 
address to ssh into. 

Note a few things, you will want to set the aws cli profile you use when applying the terraform. You will
also want to create and set your ssh key in AWS to use.
